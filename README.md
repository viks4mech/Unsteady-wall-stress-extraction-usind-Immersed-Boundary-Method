In Computational fluid dynamics one of the methods used for simplifying fluid-structure inter- action is immersed boundary methods. fluid structure interaction is one of the complex and computation intensive process to capture especially when the structure undergoes deformation, immersed boundary method is one such approach to simplify this.

A Direct Numerical Simulation using immersed boundary method was performed on various shape of objects and the data was captured for various flow parameters. this data is then post processed in order to analyze and compare the obtained results. 

This project explores different methods in order to accurately analyze the results of DNS data and interpolate the variables on the surface of the geometry. The code for post-processing code was available at the inception of the project for one type of geometry which was modified in order to capture various other geometrical configurations. Furthermore, a parametric study was performed changing the variables responsible for accurately determining the interpolation on the surface.
